# Altschool Cloud Engineering Project - EC2 Website Deployment

This project automates the deployment of a website on EC2 instances using Ansible, NGINX, and Application Load Balancer.

## Reference

For a detailed tutorial on this project, check out the Medium article: [Deploy a Website on EC2 Instances with Automation](https://medium.com/@kindsonegbule15/deploy-a-website-on-ec2-instances-with-automation-7235dadbe5e4)

## Project Structure

my-ansible-project/
â”œâ”€â”€ inventory/
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ hosts # Ansible inventory file
â”œâ”€â”€ playbook.yml # Main deployment playbook
â”œâ”€â”€ ansible.cfg # Ansible configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ index.html # Universal HTML file (works on EC2, ALB, and S3)
â””â”€â”€ README.md # This file

## Prerequisites

1. âœ… Two EC2 instances launched (Ubuntu/Amazon Linux)
2. SSH key pair for accessing instances
3. Ansible installed on local machine
4. Security groups allowing HTTP (port 80) and SSH (port 22)

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Update Inventory File

Edit `inventory/hosts` with your actual EC2 instance details:

```ini
[webservers]
web1 ansible_host=YOUR_EC2_INSTANCE_1_IP ansible_user=ubuntu ansible_ssh_private_key_file=~/.ssh/your-key.pem
web2 ansible_host=YOUR_EC2_INSTANCE_2_IP ansible_user=ubuntu ansible_ssh_private_key_file=~/.ssh/your-key.pem
```

### Step 2: Test Connectivity

```bash
ansible all -m ping
```

### Step 3: Deploy Website with NGINX

```bash
ansible-playbook playbook.yml
```

The playbook will:

- Install and configure NGINX on both servers
- Deploy the universal HTML file that works everywhere
- Each server will show its own IP address dynamically
- Create health check endpoint for load balancer
- Use default NGINX configuration (simple and reliable)

### Step 4: Deploy on S3

- Use AWS console to create an S3 bucket
- Move the web files to the bucket
- Configure permission issues
- Enable static hosting 

### Step 4: Set up Application Load Balancer

Set up ALB through AWS Console:

1. Create Target Group with your EC2 instances
2. Create Application Load Balancer
3. Configure health checks to use `/health` endpoint
4. Update security groups to allow ALB traffic

## Features

- âœ… Automated NGINX installation and configuration
- âœ… Universal HTML file that works on EC2, ALB, and S3
- âœ… Dynamic IP detection with visual indicators:
  - ðŸŸ¢ **Green**: Server-side detected (most accurate)
  - ðŸŸ  **Orange**: Load balancer IP
  - ðŸ”µ **Blue**: Client-side detected
  - ðŸŸ£ **Purple**: S3 static website
- âœ… Health check endpoint for load balancer (`/health`)
- âœ… Proper file permissions and ownership
- âœ… Service management (start/enable NGINX)
- âœ… Firewall configuration

## Verification

After running the playbook, verify deployment:

1. Check website: `http://YOUR_EC2_IP`
2. Check health endpoint: `http://YOUR_EC2_IP/health`

## Project Completion Status

âœ… **All project objectives completed successfully:**

1. âœ… Launch 2 EC2 instances on AWS (Free Tier)
2. âœ… Create and deploy HTML page showing server IP address
3. âœ… Use Ansible to install NGINX and automate deployment
4. âœ… Set up Application Load Balancer for traffic distribution

**ALB URL:** <http://my-first-alb-1239242874.eu-north-1.elb.amazonaws.com>

## Troubleshooting

- Check Ansible logs: `/tmp/ansible.log`
- Verify NGINX status: `sudo systemctl status nginx`
- Check NGINX error logs: `sudo tail -f /var/log/nginx/error.log`

## Universal HTML File Usage

- The **same HTML file** (`index.html`) is used for EC2, Load Balancer, and S3 deployments.
- No server-side code (like PHP or Jinja2) is required; all logic is handled via Bash scripting in the Ansible playbook using the `sed` command.
- For EC2 and Load Balancer, the page displays the actual serving instance's public IP address, which is injected during deployment using Bash scripting.
- For S3, the page will display the placeholder text as-is since no dynamic IP replacement occurs in static hosting.
- This ensures a consistent user experience and meets the project requirement to use the same file everywhere.

## How It Works

- **Direct EC2 Access:** Shows the public IP address of the EC2 instance, replaced by Bash scripting during deployment.
- **Load Balancer Access:** Shows the public IP address of the EC2 instance serving the request, replaced by Bash scripting during deployment.
- **S3 Static Website:** Shows the original placeholder text since no dynamic replacement occurs in S3 static hosting.

## Deployment Notes

- Always use the same `index.html` file for all environments.
- The IP address is dynamically replaced using Bash scripting in the Ansible playbook during deployment to EC2 instances.
- For S3, you will need to manually edit the HTML file to replace the placeholder with appropriate text before uploading.
- No need to maintain separate files for different environments.
