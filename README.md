# Altschool Cloud Engineering Project - EC2 Website Deployment

This project automates the deployment of a website on EC2 instances using Ansible, NGINX, and Application Load Balancer.

## Project Structure

my-ansible-project/
â”œâ”€â”€ inventory/
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ hosts # Ansible inventory file
â”œâ”€â”€ playbook.yml # Main deployment playbook
â”œâ”€â”€ ansible.cfg # Ansible configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ index.html # Universal HTML file (works on EC2, ALB, and S3)
â””â”€â”€ README.md # This file

## Prerequisites

1. âœ… Two EC2 instances launched (Ubuntu/Amazon Linux)
2. SSH key pair for accessing instances
3. Ansible installed on local machine
4. Security groups allowing HTTP (port 80) and SSH (port 22)

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Update Inventory File

Edit `inventory/hosts` with your actual EC2 instance details:

```ini
[webservers]
web1 ansible_host=YOUR_EC2_INSTANCE_1_IP ansible_user=ubuntu ansible_ssh_private_key_file=~/.ssh/your-key.pem
web2 ansible_host=YOUR_EC2_INSTANCE_2_IP ansible_user=ubuntu ansible_ssh_private_key_file=~/.ssh/your-key.pem
```

### Step 2: Test Connectivity

```bash
ansible all -m ping
```

### Step 3: Deploy Website with NGINX

```bash
ansible-playbook playbook.yml
```

The playbook will:

- Install and configure NGINX on both servers
- Deploy the universal HTML file that works everywhere
- Each server will show its own IP address dynamically
- Create health check endpoint for load balancer
- Use default NGINX configuration (simple and reliable)

### Step 4: Set up Application Load Balancer

Set up ALB through AWS Console:

1. Create Target Group with your EC2 instances
2. Create Application Load Balancer
3. Configure health checks to use `/health` endpoint
4. Update security groups to allow ALB traffic

## Features

- âœ… Automated NGINX installation and configuration
- âœ… Universal HTML file that works on EC2, ALB, and S3
- âœ… Dynamic IP detection with visual indicators:
  - ðŸŸ¢ **Green**: Server-side detected (most accurate)
  - ðŸŸ  **Orange**: Load balancer IP
  - ðŸ”µ **Blue**: Client-side detected
  - ðŸŸ£ **Purple**: S3 static website
- âœ… Health check endpoint for load balancer (`/health`)
- âœ… Proper file permissions and ownership
- âœ… Service management (start/enable NGINX)
- âœ… Firewall configuration

## Verification

After running the playbook, verify deployment:

1. Check website: `http://YOUR_EC2_IP`
2. Check health endpoint: `http://YOUR_EC2_IP/health`

## Project Completion Status

âœ… **All project objectives completed successfully:**

1. âœ… Launch 2 EC2 instances on AWS (Free Tier)
2. âœ… Create and deploy HTML page showing server IP address
3. âœ… Use Ansible to install NGINX and automate deployment
4. âœ… Set up Application Load Balancer for traffic distribution

**ALB URL:** <http://my-first-alb-1239242874.eu-north-1.elb.amazonaws.com>

## Troubleshooting

- Check Ansible logs: `/tmp/ansible.log`
- Verify NGINX status: `sudo systemctl status nginx`
- Check NGINX error logs: `sudo tail -f /var/log/nginx/error.log`

## Universal HTML File Usage

- The **same HTML file** (`index.html`) is used for EC2, Load Balancer, and S3 deployments.
- No server-side code (like PHP or Jinja2) is required; all logic is handled via JavaScript and static files.
- For EC2 and Load Balancer, the page displays the actual serving instance's public IP address using a small JSON file (`server-info.json`) generated by each server.
- For S3, the page will display "S3 Static Website" (if you add S3 detection logic in JavaScript).
- This ensures a consistent user experience and meets the project requirement to use the same file everywhere.

## How It Works

- **Direct EC2 Access:** Shows the public IP address of the EC2 instance.
- **Load Balancer Access:** Shows the public IP address of the EC2 instance serving the request (via `server-info.json`).
- **S3 Static Website:** (Optional) Shows "S3 Static Website" if S3 detection is enabled in JavaScript.

## Deployment Notes

- Always use the same `index.html` file for all environments.
- For S3, you may need to manually upload the file and adjust detection logic if you want a custom message.
- No need to maintain separate files for different environments.
